Unit Testing Plan — Garden Stage Simulation

Goal:
The goal of this testing is to make sure that the small parts (functions) of my program
work correctly before running the full simulation. I will test the function called
stage_from_string() that changes a stage name like "SEEDLING", "GROWING", or "MATURE"
into a number. I will also test insert_from_csv_line(), which reads one line of data
and puts the plant name into the right place in the map.

How I will test:
I will use a small test program to check these functions. The program will try different
inputs and see if the output is what we expect. For example, if we send "SEEDLING" to
stage_from_string(), it should return the number for SEEDLING. If we send a wrong word
like "TREE", it should return -1. I will also test that good data lines are added to the
map and bad lines are ignored.

Expected result:
When all the tests work correctly, the test program will print:
"[OK] All unit tests passed."
